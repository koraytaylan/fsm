# Provisioned ordinary workflow fixture review — 2026-10-07

The original four mcp_execute_workflow tests and their nine scenarios retain
their ordering, compensation, external-resource, acknowledgement and verified
journal assertions and original per-scenario deadline. A private test manifest
can supply separately registered physical stores, external resource paths,
the exact staged CLI and a compact private operator home; it does not select
a different executor. Without the manifest the existing test environment and
production CLI remain unchanged, including the currently failing Linux cases.

The root fixture uses the existing strict root-only store transfer and genuine
broker daemon, publishes each immutable catalogue before allocation, and runs
the copied original test binary after dropping supplementary groups, GID and
UID to 65534. The helper binary lives outside ProtectHome in an exclusively
created protected staging directory. Artifact reads reject symlinks, nonfiles
and more than 64 MiB, and authenticate bounded bytes before any executable
publication. The producer packages only debug-stripped exact Cargo artifacts;
the frozen full-gate CLI is 84 MiB unstripped, exceeding that unchanged bound.
Debug assertions and optimization defaults are not changed by packaging.

External resource files are initialized while their directory is root-private,
then made writable for distinct contained DynamicUser allocations; the work
result remains readable by its separate operator observer. Store/control paths
stay private and executable/catalogue paths stay protected. Native final socket
paths are checked against the transport limit. Cleanup checks original resource
and home inodes, then uses existing changed/populated/unknown-domain refusal;
only complete matched fixture teardown retires staged bytes. No namespace or
cgroup absence is promoted into a production closure receipt.

After each original scenario group, independent root readback requires the
exact native allocation and Claimed/Stopped/Settled counts, no unresolved run,
and an original protected closure receipt for every claim and physical store.
These checks reject a legacy route even if it produces the expected external
workflow effects. Four verified-case markers bind the producer's nine-scenario
verdict; missing markers cannot pass. The producer retains authority and staged
bytes on unknown teardown, saves timeout diagnostics with unknown exit status,
and preserves the original TimeoutExpired cause.

Seven permanent mocked producer tests pass; neutralizing namespace, staged-file
or missing-case guards individually fails their cached sensitivity controls,
with restored tests passing. No native process executes in these mocked tests.
Stable all-target CLI/executor Clippy, MSRV compilation, size checks and the
existing real env-cleared helper control pass in native-workflow-fixture-final-
check.log under serial asserted 1 GiB/zero-swap scopes. Earlier check logs record
a six-line size excess and then an ancestor-visibility compile refusal; the
setup is now in its own module and the original root-only ownership assertions
are unchanged. Actual registered production workflow execution remains pending;
compilation and mocked evidence do not promote task 9401 or release its gate.
